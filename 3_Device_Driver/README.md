# Device Driver in Embedded Linux

## Overview

In Embedded Linux systems, a device driver acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the operating system (software), allowing the operating system (software) to interact with the hardware devices. It provides a standardized way to access and control hardware devices, abstracting the hardware details from the application software.

## Types of Devices

### Character Devices

Character devices transfer data one character at a time, such as keyboards, mice, and serial ports.

### Block Devices

Block devices handle data in blocks, typically 512 bytes or larger, and include devices like EEPROM, hard drives, SSDs, and SD cards.

### Network Devices

Network devices handle network communication, such as Ethernet interfaces , wireless adapters and Bluetooth.

## Types of Modules

### Built-in Modules (Static in tree)

These modules are compiled directly into the Linux kernel and are loaded at boot time. They are essential for basic system functionality.

### Loadable Modules (Dynamic Module)

Loadable modules are separate from the kernel and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. They allow for modular and flexible system configurations.

## Commands


## Conclusion

Understanding device drivers and modules is crucial for developing and maintaining Embedded Linux systems. By knowing the types of devices, modules, and commands available, developers can effectively manage and interact with hardware devices in their systems.
